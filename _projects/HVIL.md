As a researcher at the Texas A&M University Hypervelocity Impact Laboratory (HVIL), I am part of a team focused on advancing materials and structures to mitigate hypervelocity impact (HVI) threats, such as those posed by hypersonic weapons, micrometeoroid/orbital debris, and atmospheric reentry conditions. The crux of my work in the HVIL involves firing a two-stage light gas gun (2SLGG), which launches projectiles at velocities of 1.5 to 8.0 km/s. This allows us to simulate real-world extreme conditions and study the behavior of various materials, such as metals, polymers, and composites, under these high-strain-rate conditions.

### High Strain-Rate Computational Modeling

In my research, I helped develop and test high-fidelity computational models that simulate the effects of HVI on materials and structures. We use advanced supercomputing resources from both the university and the Department of Defense (DoD) to perform simulations using finite element models, smooth particle hydrodynamics, and molecular dynamics (MD) codes like LAMMPS. These models help us predict how materials will respond at the nano and micro scales under extreme conditions, which directly informs our experimental work and material design for mitigating HVI threats. These are additionally verified using microscopy as shown below.

### Material Characterization and Testing

At HVIL, I also contribute to material characterization efforts. We perform detailed analysis of materials exposed to HVI conditions using optical and scanning electron microscopy. These techniques allow us to examine fracture surfaces at various magnifications, giving us insights into failure modes during extreme dynamic events. Additionally, we study the properties of lightweight polymers, which are increasingly used in protective shielding for space and military applications. We utilize several techniques, such as dynamic mechanical analysis (DMA) and thermogravimetric analysis (TGA), to understand polymer behavior under high strain-rate impacts.

### General Material Property Characterization

In addition to specialized testing for polymers, I am involved in characterizing a variety of materials, including metals, composites, and concrete, using standard ASTM tests. These tests measure properties such as hardness, impact strength, tensile strength, and density, all of which are critical for understanding how materials perform under HVI conditions. This comprehensive testing and modeling approach allows us to develop more effective materials and structures for protecting against extreme threats.
