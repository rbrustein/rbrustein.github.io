Hi, I'm Roman. I’m a Mechanical Engineering student at Texas A&M University, graduating in May 2025 with a strong focus on design, process engineering, and thermal analysis. I enjoy tackling challenging engineering problems by combining technical knowledge with practical, hands-on experience.

My background includes work in product development, simulation analysis, and advanced manufacturing techniques, complemented by skills in CAD design, programming, and data-driven analysis. Whether collaborating with industry leaders or leading engineering teams, I’m driven to create innovative and impactful solutions.

This portfolio showcases my most impactful projects, where creativity, precision, and engineering excellence come together.
